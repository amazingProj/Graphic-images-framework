# Project in introduction to SWE
This project is based on designing and modeling a virtual 3-dimensional graphical scene, with all the physics
involved (light source, rays, reflections, refractions, color, occlusions etc.).


Course Objective:

• To gain hands-on practice in acquiring proficiency in a new problem domain and to develop
abstract description of it

• To develop understanding and appreciation of complex software projects

• To understand the basic mechanisms of object-oriented modelling and abstraction

• To understand the flow from an idea to code

• To understand and apply principles of class design

• To develop an intuition of basic design patterns to address design challenges

• To understand and apply techniques supporting Agile Development: Refactoring, Testfirst
programming and Pair programming.
